# Style Guide Challenges

Working on more and more projcets, you’ll notice that you build variations of the same page elements many times over. We build lots of nav bars, modals, tabbed information, and other common layout structures and patterns. On large projects, we may even build the same type of elements numerous times in slightly different ways, leading to visual inconsistencies, unclear design, and hard-to-maintain code. The more you do this, the more you notice it. Small inconsistencies in implementation can be a big pain on larger projects, leading to wasted time and a lot of duplication. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a base template we could refer back to so we could get these elements built more quickly and more consistently the next time we need them? Well, good news! We can do just that using a style guide.

As defined by Brad Frost’s [Style Guide](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guides/) Best Practices: “Style guides and pattern libraries are essential tools to help Web teams maintain sanity while creating experiences for our multi-device Web.” At it’s core, a style guide is about building a cohesive and reusable system of parts rather than building complete individual pages of a product. It’s an exercise in breaking down your project into it’s smallest components, rather than tackling your project as a whole. A style guide becomes a tool that allows us to direct other developers’ approach to working within out codebase, and guides how designers should approach creating [additions](http://refills.bourbon.io/) to an existing visual language.

By focusing on the parts that make up the whole, we are allowing ourselves to maintain consistency of elements across our site, and to build content that is modular with a cohesive design approach tying it all together.

Every week we were given a specific page element to build. It was to be responsive, and the HTML, CSS, and JS was to be written in a highly reusable way. The goal is to create a small library of page components that can be quickly and easily dropped into a project with minimal work to integrate them into a codebase.

Each week we were given a new page element to build, and by the end of the module we had created a style guide. As outlined in Brad Frost’s Style Guide overviews, I focused on creating a pattern library and code style guide for each element. I focused on semantic HTML, well organized and clear CSS, and DRY, well factored Javascript.
